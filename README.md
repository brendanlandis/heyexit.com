LASTLY
- make sure HTML elements are modern, not just a bunch of divs

LATER
- decide what to do about those youtube videos that won't download
- menu column won't scroll vertically
- recordings page -> desktop layout -> some of those titles could be sized better
- write about old hey exit releases
	- Arm's Reach
		Nori and I might not have thought of it this way going in, but in hindsight *Arm’s Reach* feels like an album concerned with *scale*. When I hear it now, I think of words like wide, cavernous, towering, distant, (pardon me but) deep. It doesn’t necessarily go longer than is typical for the genre, but it kind of behaves like something that does.
		As I write this I’m listening to it on the Q train. There’s a mariachi guy across from me singing and playing guitar. The conductor announces we’re at Atlantic Ave. The train violently klik-klaks against the tracks, the AC whooshes, a baby cries, another passenger blasts an rnb ballad from his phone speakers. Through it all, earbuds on max, I can make out maybe 30-40% of the music I’m writing about.
		One thing I think of with this music is the quiet busyness of geography - the way silence behaves in nature. I think how we perceive nature as being quiet, but how if we adjust our ears to it,  it’s aurally quite busy most of the time.
