DESIGN

- go through mailchimp archive and transfer any writing on albums, cross-check event info, etc.
- check out how ampwall does things. are there any fields I should add to the CMS?

LASTLY

- do an a11y pass
- make sure HTML elements are modern, not just a bunch of divs

LATER

- decide what to do about those youtube videos that won't download
- menu column won't scroll vertically
- recordings page -> desktop layout -> some of those titles could be sized better
