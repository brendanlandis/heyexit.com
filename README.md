TODO

PLUMBING
- add analytics (https://umami.is/docs/install)
- get vimeo working again in RecordingPromoVideos.tsx
- url doesn’t update on my phone when I navigate around the site. I have to reload the page for the url to update

CONTENT
- check writing in each recording
- revise writing on home page
- add videos to Anura and Nothing
- decide what to do about those youtube videos that won't download

VISUAL BROAD STROKES
- do a typography pass on front page (and really whole site)

VISUAL BUGS
- phone → it breaks page → recording detail page: carousel: images align-top instead of aligning center
- project page → mobile view → scrolls horizontally, might be a too-long word in a too-big font

LASTLY
- do an a11y pass
