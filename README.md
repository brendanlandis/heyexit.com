TODO


- check content of each recording
- verify git identity on slowhouse
- url doesn’t update on my phone when I navigate around the site. I have to reload the page for the url to update
- phone → it breaks page → recording detail page: carousel: images align-top instead of aligning center
- fwd www to naked domain
- project page → mobile view → scrolls horizontally, might be a too-long word in a too-big font
- do a typography pass on front page (and really whole site)
