TODO

DESIGN
- do a typography pass on front page (and really whole site)
- add social icons to nav and footer
- do a pass on Current Projects page

VISUAL BUGS
- phone → it breaks page → recording detail page: carousel: images align-top instead of aligning center
- project page → mobile view → scrolls horizontally, might be a too-long word in a too-big font

LASTLY
- do an a11y pass
- make sure HTML elements are modern, not just a bunch of divs

NO EFFECT (YET)
- get vimeo working again in RecordingPromoVideos.tsx
- decide what to do about those youtube videos that won't download
